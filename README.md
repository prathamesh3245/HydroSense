HydroSense 🌱💧

A smart plant watering system using Arduino that automatically waters your plants based on real-time soil moisture levels.

🚀 Features
- Detects soil dryness using a moisture sensor
- Automatically activates water pump when needed
- Low-cost & efficient setup for home gardening

🧠 Tech Stack
- **Microcontroller**: Arduino UNO
- **Sensors**: Soil Moisture Sensor
- **Language**: Embedded C

🛠️ Hardware Required
- Arduino UNO
- Soil Moisture Sensor
- Relay Module
- Submersible Pump
- Jumper Wires, Power Supply

🗂 File Structure
- `HydroSense.ino` – Core Arduino logic
- `README.md` – Project details and setup
- `CircuitDiagram/` – Circuit layout and hardware connections

📸 Demo
*(Add wiring diagram and real setup image if possible)*

🧪 How It Works
1. Moisture sensor detects soil status.
2. If moisture < threshold, relay triggers the pump.
3. Pump waters the plant until optimal moisture is restored.
